#RFP tips and tricks

= Introduction =

Results File Plotter (RFP) was written as an alternative to Excel for quickly viewing experimental results- particularly from traversed instruments- quickly and easily. It has evolved to allow final output of results by passing data to gnuplot for publication-quality graphing.


= Details =

RFP ingests Results files produced by Measurement.vi- although has been extended to work with other file types also. It is fundamentally a column-based plotter, where each row describes one measurement point. Data can be filtered based on the value of multiple columns, and the resulting data subset can be plotted, any column against any other. Surface plots and vector plots of the filtered subset are also possible, as is saving of all, or some, columns of the subsetted data.
A "template" file controls the names that will be used for columns when plotting. This allows columns from disparate sources, with differing names, to be brought in to a single column.
Also stored in the template file, for each desired column:
  * "tolerances" to be used for "binning" slightly different values- for instance jittery traverse locations- into a single group. Also the precision with which to display that column.
  * "maths" definitions, allowing a column to be created which is a mathematical combination (within a single row) of columns.
  * Omit rows having particular values
  * Replace text strings- useful for "normalising" comments
  * Ignoring based on strings in other columns (does this omit the whole row, or just NaN/ blank this "cell"?)
There are also options per column for "Minimum value", "Folder level", "Summarise" and "Dispose", whose meanings may now be lost in the mists of time...!

= Usage =

To start a new project, for which you don't have a template file, the workflow goes something like...
  * Start RFP from the Post Process tab in EnFlo Hub
  * RFP will attempt to load its previous data and template, allow it, and then press Stop, or abort if required.
  * In the "Load" tab, delete the text in the "Template" path box
  * Press the "Empty File Array" button
  * Start RFP using the Run Arrow
  * You will be prompted to select data to plot; navigate to the file, or folder, of interest
  * If you selected "Selection of files from a folder", select the subset of files in the folder you wish to plot.
The file will be read in, and all channels in the file (which can be an overwhelming number!) will be available to plot, or use as selectors. At this point, you will probably want to make a template file, to reduce the number of columns available, and to improve their names over those used at acquisition time. To make a template file:
  * Press "Edit Template File", top-centre on the panel.
  * Choose a name and location for the template file; it can be helpful to give it the "fake" extension ".tpt" to remind yourself what it is. Template files are tab-separated plain text, and _can_ be edited in Excel if required, tho this can be challenging.
  * Next it is usually easiest to use "Add New Channels from file" to choose which columns from the results file you *do* want to work with.
  * This presents a list of all the columns present in the results file, in a multi-selectable listbox. A filter is provided to find specific channels more easily. Channels need not all be selected in one "hit"; a few can be selected and then "banked" with the OK button, and then further channels added, to avoid tricky multi-selects.
  * The selected channels will now appear in the Edit_Template_File.vi listbox. Highlighting a channel in the listbox will bring up its details in the cluster on the right.

You could now start plotting with the channels you've chosen, but... Now is a good time to shorten, simplify, clarify the names of the imported data, and maybe change their order:
  * Highlight a channel in the listbox- for example "Date:of:Measurement"
  * In the topmost box, replace this with the desired, shorter, channel name- such as "Date". Be sure after changing the name to click elsewhere on the panel to confirm your text entry.
  * Repeat for all channels whose names you'd like to simplify
  * To change the order of channels, or remove any accidentally included, press "Organise Channels"; this allows you to nudge channels, or multiple channels, up or down the channel order, and delete single or multiple channels (with a warning)

Now, you might like to try plotting your data...!
