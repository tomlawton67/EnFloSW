#A page to see how the wiki works- whether we could use it for a manual

= Introduction =

It would be nice to have a shared web location for a user-editable manual for using EnFloSW


= Details =

The manual is currently a collection of HTML files that travels with the code; it would be good if they were more dynamic, and could be edited by users.

  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
