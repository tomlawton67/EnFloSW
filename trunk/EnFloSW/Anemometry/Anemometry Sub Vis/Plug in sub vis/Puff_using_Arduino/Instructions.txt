1. Plug Arduino into PC and determine COM port number
2. Open vi named "Run Once at Start" and select above COM port number in 'VISA resource' menu and save as default value
   This vi MUST be run once to lock the Arduino COM port. Either insert this vi somewhere in the main code, or run it manually before doing puffs
3. Use the vi "Puff_using_Arduino" in the same way as "Puff_using_ADAM", wiring in values for number of cycles (blocks), hold on and hold off times (in MICROSECONDS)
4. The Arduino will report the number of completed cycles as it goes, and the vi will end when the completed cycles equals the demanded number OR a timeout occurs (fault)
   The successfully completed number of cycles and the error state are output from this vi.

5. :-D


P.S. I have done steps 1 and 2 (except for the calling in main code) for you already :-)
